## Description
  This repository is for an app that aids in note taking. The landing page leads to a notes page that allows for the creation of notes, with a title and body. created notes are listed along the left side and can be selected and called from storage to the screen. Also, one can delete any notes by clicking the trash can button on the left side. This app was created using express, uuid, npm, and Node.js. It is also deployed to Heroku. I would  like to thank my classmates for helping me with this project and especially Cody Bonsma.
